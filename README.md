## Welcome

Welcome to the public but back end home of [Play by Bardia](https://playnorfolk.club/). My name it Miguel and I dabble in a bunch of random both online and where grass grows. I wanted to learn how people collaborate online and I felt that this would be a good mini project to push along. If you've ever worked on something at this exhibit you're welcome to [create a pull request](https://github.com/MiggyL0/PlaybyBardia/pulls) and contribute to this site repo! 🔥🔥🔥

For everyone else, I'm happy to review and look at requests, but we live in the real world and I need to be careful of malicious attacks. I appreciate the understanding 🙏, you're free to browse either way!

## Meet the Makers

There is already a page  for our creators on the actual [site](https://playnorfolk.club/casting-call/). However, if you are a creator and you are reading this I encourage you to add a bio! Maybe discuss and make pages for projects you are working on. This is a playground as well! I know github is not everyone's strong suit, but if you would like to add something here and are not sure how [reach out to me](https://dot.cards/migueloutdoors). 😄
