## Welcome

Welcome to the public but back end home of [Play by Bardia](https://playnorfolk.club/). My name in Miguel and I dabble in a bunch of random projects both online and where grass grows 🪴. I wanted to learn how people collaborate online and I felt that this would be a good mini project to push along. If you've ever worked on something at this exhibit you're welcome to [DM me](https://dot.cards/migueloutdoors) and request write access so you can contribute to this repo! 🔥🔥🔥

For everyone else, I'm happy to review and look at [pull requests](https://github.com/MiggyL0/PlaybyBardia/pulls), but we live in the real world and I need to be careful of malicious attacks. I appreciate the understanding 🙏. Of course, you're free to browse either way!

## Meet the Makers

There is already a page for our creators on the actual [site](https://playnorfolk.club/casting-call/). However, if you are a maker at Play and you are reading this, I encourage you to add a bio! Maybe discuss and make pages for projects you are working on. This, like the installation is a playground as well! I know github is not everyone's strong suit, but if you would like to add something here and are not sure how see this documentation on [contributing to projects](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects) or simply [reach out to me](https://dot.cards/migueloutdoors). 😄

### Miguel Lopez Rivera

Hello! I created this site. I'm pretty new to this immersive exhibit, but I've had a lovely time so far and I'm excited to see where my involvement here takes me. My current projects include the following

- [Sculpting-a-Wooden-Phoenix](https://github.com/MiggyL0/PlaybyBardia/blob/17e2d94bf985aee8eba82a160eec7179f0d0c125/Sculpting-a-Wooden-Phoenix.md#L3)
- [[Learning-To-Fire-Spin]] 🔥
- [Trash-Tree](https://github.com/MiggyL0/PlaybyBardia/blob/22981456f9aabe6342f240e08160aa203f504ab9/Trash-Tree.md#L11)
- Carving A Rose From Wood

<!-- [[Fénix]][[Trash-Tree]] -->

I've come to enjoy painting this past winter as well. I'm starting small but at some point I would like to go bigger and bigger until I am comfortable painting a mural at my future home 🏡.
