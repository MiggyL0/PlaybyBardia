I have no idea what will happen here.

## Welcome

Welcome to the public but back end home of [Play by Bardia](https://playnorfolk.club/). My name it Miguel and I dabble in a bunch of random both online and where grass grows. I wanted to learn how people collaborate online and I felt that this would be a good mini project to push along. If you've ever worked on something at this exhibit you're welcome to [create a pull request](https://github.com/MiggyL0/PlaybyBardia/pulls) and contribute to this site repo!

For everyone else, I'm happy to review and look at requests, but we live in the real world and I need to be careful of malicious attacks. I appreciate the understanding üôè
